<h1>A reasonable name for the less than and greater than signs</h1>
<h2>Proposed Names: Let and Gret</h2>
<p>
  It is proposed that names be given to the signs for the "less than symbol" (<) and the "greater than symbol" (>).
</p>
<p>
  We here propose that the "<" be named a "let" - arising from the "le" and "t" in "<b><u>le</u></b>ss <b><u>t</u></b>han" and "gret" arising similarly from the "gr" and "t" in "<b><u>gr</u></b>eater <b><u>t</u></b>han" names.
</p>
<h2>The Need for a Name for a Symbol</h2>
<p>
  As rational creatures with a natural ability for symbolic ideas and communication, we humans can and should use terms to more quickly converse about the things of which we speak.  
</p>
<p>
  Take for example the "less than" (<) and "greater than" (>) symbols - which themselves are abstractions of at least two ideas. The first use is normally learned in gradeschool or the like and represents a way to compare the value of two quantities: 5<10. x>-3.  A second use is as an organizational structure in various coding situations, including most ubiquitously in the hyper text markup language (html).  "&ltp&gt" for example signifies the start of a new paragraph on a webpage.  The use of the less than and greater than are not to signify a difference in value but to organize tags that separate different content pieces in the html document.  
</p>
<p>
  The need for names of "<" and ">" in practice for both of the situations is not highly necessary, but as a pedagogical tool the frequent reference gives a functional need for specific terms to be used.
</p>
<h2>Situation where the Need is Aparent</h2>
<p>
  In the classroom setting teaching html, a student often may forget to include the let or gret in their markup.  Student S may type "&lta href=index.html Click here&gt". The correct typing would look more like this: "&lta href=index.html&gt Click here&lt/a&gt". An instructor could quickly communicate to the student that they need an extra gret after the index.html as well as a let and a gret around the /a to form the closing tag "&lt/a&gt".  Giving these terms serves at least two purposes:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Allows the two individuals to more quickly communicate about the different pieces as needed</li>
	<li>Having a term may further enable the student to create an abstraction of the concept and give them more faculty to understand the purpose of the symbol in this context</li>

</ol>
<p>
  The second purpose in particular is an essential aspect of the learning process - that is, giving an individual the ability to masterfully (read - as a teacher does) use a concept for their benefit and the benefit of another. Students tend to better apply a concept and rules when they understand the logic and reasoning for those rules. This naming proposal of the let and gret is an example in situ of education where a term given to an abstract concept empowers the learner to understand the concept and apply it more readily.
</p>
<h2>Other Current Examples</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The let and gret are used in php as it is also intertwined with html.</li>
  <li>The let and the gret are used for wrapping around a generics (for example &ltE&gt).</li>
  <li>The bitwise operators in a number of languages use two lets and grets successively.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>
  The author does not contend that this is the best naming convention or that it will significanlty increase the ability for a student to learn and discuss these concepts. However, in practice, the author has noticed a quicker grasp of the concept by students.
</p>
<p>
  Enjoy!
